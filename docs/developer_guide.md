# Development

To get set up, please run:

`make dev-env`

which will create an editable install of your `mlt` repo.

You can then set up an alias to `mlt`, so you don't have to activate your .venv/.venv3 if you don't want to.

`alias mlt='/Users/robertso/mlt/.venv/bin/mlt'`

You can put this in your `~/.bash_profile` or similar file.

Then you can run `mlt` from anywhere and it'll run your current repo codebase.

#### NOTE: If you run any test locally, you'll need to redo the dev-env because tests install non-editable versions of mlt

# Testing

### E2E Testing Options

`make test-e2e`: Use docker-compose to spin up a testing container and run tests; uses hyperkube.

`make test-e2e-no-docker`: Use your local environment to run e2e tests, similar to the way `make test` runs unit tests.

### External Container Registry

```
EXTRA_ARGS=`$MLT_REGISTRY_AUTH_COMMAND` make test-e2e-no-docker
```

where `$MLT_REGISTRY_AUTH_COMMAND` is something like below, which you can put in a `~/.bash_profile` or similar file.

`export MLT_REGISTRY_AUTH_COMMAND="gcloud container clusters get-credentials {location} --zone {zone} --project {projectname}"`

You will also need the environment variable `MLT_REGISTRY` set, something like below.

`export MLT_REGISTRY=gcr.io/{projectname}`


### Partial Test Running

This will only run the `test_simple_deploy` e2e test
```
TESTFILES=tests/e2e/test_deploy_flow.py::test_simple_deploy make test...
```


### Passing extra opts to a test (unit or e2e)

```
TESTOPTS='-s' make test
```
